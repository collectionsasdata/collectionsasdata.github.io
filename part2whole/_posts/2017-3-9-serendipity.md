Last week, Collections as Data held its national forum. During the forum we decided to forego a focus on talks and instead dedicated the bulk of time  to participants working in small groups on collections as data challenges. The project team is currently spending time getting this work ready for public release - hoping for soonerish rather than laterish.  

In the interim, we thought it would be ⚡ fun ⚡  to create a platform for [sharing collections as data ideas](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/ideas/). Drawing on Jason Heppler’s [whatisdigitalhumanities](http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/), our implementation provides random, serendipitous-like access to collections as data ideas generated leading up to the forum, during the forum, and ... hopefully by you!
