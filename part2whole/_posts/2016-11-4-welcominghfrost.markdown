Today we are pleased to announce that [**Hannah Frost**](https://profiles.stanford.edu/hannah-frost), Manager of Product and Service Management at Stanford University Libraries joins the Always Already Computational project team as a Co-Investigator. Hannah replaces Patricia Hswe who recently transitioned to the Mellon Foundation(congrats Patricia!). 

Hannah has a wealth of experience specifying, managing, and delivering digital library services including digitization, project management, born-digital archiving, web archiving, and repository-based preservation and publishing services. We believe that Hannah significantly strengthens our ability to achieve the goals we have set forth in the project. 

Please join us in welcoming Hannah!
