How do we account for data collection that accounts for haunting imprints and outright absences in the archives upon which we depend? ,"Gabrielle Foreman, Labanya Mookerjee",
"Not all of the data we create or purchase for library collections comes in neat multi-gigabyte packages of ordered files ... we recently discovered that datasets we had purchased as part of a database licensing negotiation were more shelf ready than machine ready ... they currently exist as stacks of hard drives, discs, and other bewildering formats sitting on a book cart. How do we provide access to these data collections?",Harriett Green,
". . . I would ask, how can we conceptualize the full spectrum of data usability? It is not enough for us to digitize the collection materials and for the data to exist on someone's server ... usability encompasses data formats, tool interoperability [and] the negotiated permissions and rights for researchers to share and manipulate data as they engage in analytic workflows. ",Harriett Green,
"If library collections, including but not limited to that of digital repository platforms, are considered ... there is a wealth of data and metadata ... that already exists. Better yet, memory institutions already work with this *data at scale using traditional and emerging technologies that underpin and are hidden by delivery and discovery interfaces. How can this underlying ecosystem be better leveraged for computational data analysis by researchers? ... do we just need to make access to a Solr index publicly available? Can we plug into our library data ETL systems a public Hadoop integration point? Do we need to better document and expose to new communities our existing data APIs or data exchange protocols? ",Christina Harlow,
"Capacious collections data must remember enough and forget enough to be useful. For which terms will we expend the effort to do this reconciliation? Which edge cases will we try to capture in an ever-more-complex data model? Opinions on how to draw that line will frequently set the librarian, the historian, and the machine at cross purposes. Outlining the necessary competencies a collections data production team needs, and the key questions, in order to navigate perspectives must therefore be a crucial output ...",Matthew Lincoln,
"The most potentially kinetic computationally amenable data comes from the conversion and processing of documents themselves. Transforming documents into data at the New York Public Library took the form of small projects that converted special collection materials into datasets through the power of algorithms, staff, and the crowd. The results were a domain specific dataset often with a necessarily unique data model. Taking stock of the growing number of these datasets we theorized about their possible integration with our traditional metadata systems. Would it be possible to go beyond simply linking to the dataset as a digital asset? If we were to build a RDF metadata system from the ground up could we begin thinking of it as an open-world assumption system where the contents of these datasets could exist alongside traditional bibliographic metadata? ",Matthew Miller,
". . . when thinking about ... resources as discrete datasets, what work could be done to improve their use and interoperability?

And what sort of resources are required in an organization to process datasets for public consumption? ",Matthew Miller,
Are researchers genuinely invited to engage with library collections as data?,Anna Neatrour,
"What does a digital collections as data repository look like? Providing additional layers and portals that leverage computational exploration to existing collections might serve as an intermediate step.

"Could our digital repositories provide a mechanism for researchers to curate their own research collections, providing a space where digital library objects could be combined with researcher supplied data?",Anna Neatrour,
"Data without context is meaningless. Data with context but without social awareness is deceptively meaningless. With that deception comes, in the worst case, the use and articulation of argument founded on a lack of understanding and awareness of perpetuating ideas that are intrinsically linked to the creation and curation of said data. A question for this group would be; how do we attempt to preserve that context without overwhelming the user?",Hannah Skates Kettler,
"How can we integrate generations of high-quality, professionally-created metadata with electronic versions of the object itself? Particularly when copyright comes into play, we can't simply hope for openness; and there's a steep trade-off between the thoroughness of a well-thought-out standard and a simplicity of conception that makes a digital resource useful for ... a graduate student just beginning to get interested in working with large collections.",Ben Schmidt,
"The technical demands of even downloading something like the HTRC EF set exceed both the technical competencies and computing infrastructure of most humanists--I've literally spent several weeks recently, restarting downloads and identifying missing files as I try to fill up a RAID array with several terabytes of data.

Digitization alone is not enough to support large-scale computational analysis of library collections. Rather the more difficult steps of digital curation will be necessary to prepare our collections for appropriate reuse. Partnership may be the key.,Lisa Johnston,
The librarian favors data that is standard: forgetting enough specifics about the collection in order to produce data that references the same vocabularies and thesauri as other collection datasets. The librarian's generalization aims to support access by many different communities of practice.,Matthew Lincoln,
"The historian favors data that is rich: replete with enough specifics that they may operationalize that data in pursuit of their research goals, while forgetting anything irrelevant to those goals. The historian's generalization aims to identify guiding principles or exceptional cases within a historical context. (No two historians, of course, will agree on what that context should be.)",Matthew Lincoln,
"The machine favors data that is structured: amenable to computation because it is produced in a regularized format (whether as a documented corpus of text, a series of relational tables, a semantic graph, or a store of image files with metadata.) In a statistical learning context, the machine seeks generalizations that reduce error in a given classification task, forgetting enough to be able to perform well on new data without over-fitting to the training set.",Matthew Lincoln,
"In considering how library collections can serve as data for a variety of data ingest, transformation, analysis, replication, presentation, and circulation purposes, it may be useful to compare examples of data workflows across disciplines to identify common data ""moves"" as well as points in the data trajectory that are especially in need of library support because they are for a variety of reasons brittle.",Alan Liu,
"... a comparative study of data workflow and provenance across disciplines (including sciences, social sciences, humanities, arts) conducted using workflow modeling tools could help identify high-priority ""data moves"" (nodes in the workflow graphs) for a library-based ""always already computational"" framework.",Alan Liu,
When publishing data for others it is a balance between providing access to the data in a format that provides the least friction for adoption and use versus how knowledge organization systems work within a cultural heritage institution. ,Matthew Miller,
"What are some additional use cases that could drive shared best practices or tools for releasing cultural heritage data? Are there more advanced preprocessing that could be done to some of the common archetypical data formats found in libraries, archives and museums? And what sort of resources are required in an organization to process datasets for public consumption?",Matthew Miller,
"Simply having author or creator information, or language information, can be very helpful. My impression is that many institutions are holding onto their data tightly, with the hope of cleaning and improving it in the future. But researchers can work with imperfect data, if its limitations are discussed frankly. We can also contribute improved data back to the institution.",Miriam Posner ,
"Developers at cultural institutions may feel that learning an API is trivial, but for many people, the availability of simple flat files can be the difference between using and not using a dataset. I therefore hope that cultural institutions will consider the possibility of providing unglamorous flat files, in addition to API access to their data.",Miriam Posner ,
"Really lowbrow thought about data formats. Very simply, my students can work with CSVs, but not XML or JSON. Visualizing and analyzing the latter two formats takes programming knowledge, while even non-coders can import CSVs into Excel and create graphs and charts.",Miriam Posner ,
"Case studies. It may seem unlikely, given the recent proliferation of digital humanities journals, but it's relatively difficult to find vetted, A-to-Z, soup-to-nuts examples of how to build visualizations and analysis from datasets.",Miriam Posner ,
"Rendering collections as datasets benefits from an understanding of the intangible and uncertain benefits of releasing collections as data and of the barriers to uptake, ideally grounded in conversations with or prototypes for potential users. Libraries not used to thinking of developers as 'users' or lacking the technical understanding to translate their work into benefits for more traditional audiences may find this challenging. ",Mia Ridge,
"Publishing data benefits from workflows that allow suitably cleaned or enhanced records to be re-ingested, and export processes that can regularly update published datasets (allowing errors to be corrected and enhancements shared), but these are all too rare.",Mia Ridge,
"No library collection is an island. Library collections are not simply a list of ones and zeros that wait to be consumed and reused, then spat out again as something different. At least, not when we want to be able to cite them. ",Hannah Skates Kettler,
"Understanding that our data are unique, it does not necessarily follow that access should be as unique and idiosyncratic.",Hannah Skates Kettler,
"When Google recently released half a million hours of video, they did it not as image stills but as vectorized features read by a neural network. These features - essentially, a computer's rough summary of an artifact into a few hundred numbers - could make it possible to researchers and students to immediately engage in computational analysis without having to wade through the preparatory steps. If done according to shared standards, they could make collections interoperable in striking ways even when texts or images can't be distributed.",Ben Schmidt,
"So for me, one of the key questions is how we expose data to facilitate the use of computational methods while preserving some of the difficulties and irregularities - the chisel marks in the smooth worked surface that remind us of its history and humanity.",Tim Sherratt,
"I'm not sure whether this is a metadata question, or a matter of how we frame the relationship between researcher and institution. If we think of machine-actionable data as a product or service delivered by institutions, then researchers are cast as clients or consumers. But if each dataset is not a product, but a problem, then we open up new spaces for collaboration and critique.",Tim Sherratt,
"What seems to happen fairly regularly is that I find where the systems are broken. For example, while harvesting debates from the Australian parliament's online database, I discovered about 100 sitting days were missing. This sort of thing happens with complex systems, and the staff at the Parliamentary Library have now fixed the problems. For me, it's an example of the fact that we can never simply accept what we're given. Search interfaces lie, and datasets have holes. But it also shows that once you open up channels for the transmission of data, information flows both ways.",Tim Sherratt,
"We can't talk about the need for institutions to provide computation-ready data without considering what they might get in return. The struggle for access might not always be comfortable, but it can be productive. If data is a problem to be engaged with, rather than a service to be consumed, then we can see how researchers might help institutions to see their own structures differently. On a practical level, how might we make it easier for institutions to re-ingest the features and derivative structures identified through use.",Tim Sherratt,
"I'm also a bit suspicious of scale. Big solutions aren't always best. Large data dumps are great for researchers with adequate computing power and resources, but APIs support rapid experimentation and light-weight interventions. ",Tim Sherratt,
"... while articulating best-practice for computation-ready data we shouldn't lose sight of other ways data can be exposed. I want hackable websites as well as downloadable CSVs and all that basic stuff like persistent urls, semantic html, and maybe a sprinkle of RDFa or JSON-LD ... [this] enables data to be discovered everywhere, not just in a designated repository.",Tim Sherratt,
"My perspective is on the very practical. Institutions have spent a lot of time, effort, and money on digitizing collections and establishing policies and infrastructures around the model of access that mimics analog models. Transforming the technology, staff, and practice to accommodate data analysis is a second paradigm shift that will be just as difficult. ",Kate Zwaard,
