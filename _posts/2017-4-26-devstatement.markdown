*Collections as Data National Forum, 3.3.17* 

# An Invitation
[**The Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/) was initiated during an Institute for Museum and Library Services national forum at the University of California Santa Barbara (March 1-3 2017). We invite librarians, archivists, museum professionals, researchers, journalists, artists, educators, and data producers to partner on further development of the statement. In spirit, the statement is inspired by similarly oriented efforts like [The Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/bethesda.htm) and [The Denton Declaration: An Open Data Manifesto](https://openaccess.unt.edu/denton-declaration).

# A Purpose
The Santa Barbara Statement provides a set of high level principles to guide collections as data work. By design, the principles are not meant to stand as concrete actions. Rather, the principles are meant to support the development of actions. From now to November 2018, the [**project team**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/team/) and [**current and potential partners**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/partners/) will workshop statement principles into corresponding sets of actions in collaboration with a range of specific communities. In addition to this work, the project team is developing a *Collections as Data Framework* that will include among other things **(1)** guidelines that support persona and use case development, **(2)** resources for “making the case” to engage in collections as data work **(3)** resources for running workflow hackathons **(4)** and exercises that can be used to facilitate conversations about collections as data needs at conferences, institutions, and other venues as they arise.
