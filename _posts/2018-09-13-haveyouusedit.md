Always Already Computational: Collections as Data is drawing to a close! 

If you've used anything from the project we'd love to hear about it. Have you used the [**Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/)? The [**personas**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/personas/)? The [**facets**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/facets/)? Has the project helped support any actions in your local, regional, or larger professional context? For example, a change in workflows, an influence on strategic directions, contributing to external funding effort, development of workshops, (re)defining roles and responsibilities? 

Any and all responses are welcome.
