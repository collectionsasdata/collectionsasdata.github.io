Consensus around what [collections as data means](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/) and consequently what it takes to think about, prepare, provision access to, and support the use of them remains unsettled. However, lack of consensus has not stopped a range of creative activity. Rather, it might be said that the unsettled nature of collections as data fosters a generative space that encourages novel alignments of people, purpose, and resources. In an effort to collect and communicate collections as data activity, the Collections as Data project team presents **Collections as Data Facets.**

A facet documents a collections as data implementation. An implementation consists of the people, services, practices, technologies, and infrastructure that aim to encourage computational use of cultural heritage collections. Each facet suggests practical entry points to engaging collections as data. The practical orientation of the questions that comprise the facet are directly informed by stakeholder experience. A facet covers the administrative case that was made to allow an implementation to take place, the people and roles involved in the implementation, workflows and code where applicable, assessment, and approaches to supporting use. **A growing collection of facets presents a multifaceted argument for the present and future state of collections as data.**

# Call for Submissions

We welcome submission of additional facets. Facets can describe scalable, non-scalable, experimental, work in progress, and permanent collections as data implementations. Facets from a range of sources are encouraged, e.g. libraries, museums, archives, research centers, academic departments. 

**The next round of facets are due by September 29, 2017.** 

Submissions should follow the [Facet template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_i4DEggmZDzZ_JXIIZdwF7M4bMjR36W9Vk2pjZtCho0/edit).
