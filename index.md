ðŸ’¡ *The Collections as Data: Part to Whole [**call for proposals**](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/part2whole/cfp/) is now live! Submission deadline is 10/31/2018.* ðŸ’¡ 

[**Collections as Data**](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/LG-73-16-0096-16) is an Institute of Museum and Library Services supported effort that aims to foster a strategic approach to developing, describing, providing access to, and encouraging reuse of collections that support computationally-driven research and teaching in areas including but not limited to Digital Humanities, Public History, Digital History, data driven Journalism, Digital Social Science, and Digital Art History. 

Partners will iteratively refine and extend collections as data work across 6 disciplinary and professional conferences, synchronous and asynchronous online events, this site, and other venues as they arise. This effort will produce a collections as data framework, use cases and user stories, and functional requirements that support collections as data infrastructure development.

Stay up to date with project activities and connect with others on collections as data related topics via the [**Collections as Data google group**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/collectionsasdata).
