"How to scale a “collections as data” up and down? How to accommodate top-of-system R1 universities with professional schools, I-schools, etc., and middle-tier, lower-tier, community college, small liberal arts colleges with fewer resources and expertise.","Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
Possibly structure the “collections as data” project in two parts: one driven at R1 level and aiming for high on technical/resource curve in order to drive development in 10 years time to point where low end of technical/resource curve will have the tools and protocols.,"Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
"Can there be a network approach for access and discovery? A registry of datasets/collections ready to use (with metadata, context that gives users a sense of possible uses, level of difficulty)? (Dutch example of using FAIR principles to score datasets). (Alternative: give guidance about uses and difficulty of datasets by providing usage precedents--e.g., which has been used for courses, etc.)","Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
"Can the conceptual assumptions in the library world about what is a “collection,” “archive,” “series,” etc. --and then what is a “dataset” -- be made transparent as the preliminary context that users need to understand what they can do with collections as data?","Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
"Can we expose/extract “data primitives” (named entities, geographical references, dates, etc.) that would function as a kind of lingua franca for datasets--allowing an initial way for researchers to use data in their own contexts and projects?","Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
"Is it possible to create a shared, standard “workbench” that can be embedded in collections-as-data?","Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
Follow an annotated workflow approach for describing reproducible or adaptable ways of working with datasets.,"Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
"How can we provide provenance for datasets, and data workflows? (Brown Dog project)","Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
Could iPython/Jupyter notebooks be the natural finding aid format for datasets in the future (allowing for description and also custom harvesting/searching/scraping/analysis)?,"Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
How do we deal with the outsize influence of the proprietary databases/datasets in this space?,"Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
"Instead of thinking of “collections/datasets”, perhaps think of providing unique IDs for granular data, and constructing datasets on the fly after the fact?","Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
We need a logic for where people deposit datasets -- in institutional repository? In a journal’s Dataverse? In a national or international repository?,"Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
"Can we plan for a future in which it is not datasets but Dockerized containers that are deposited in repositories  (i.e., entire computing and research workflows, including datasets)?","Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
Teach students about appropriate and good data collection/sharing practices.,"Mia Ridge, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Lisa Johnston, Greg Jansen",3/1/17
