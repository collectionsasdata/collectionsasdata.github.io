## How do researchers use collections as data?

This series is designed to help people who work in libraries, archives and museums gain a better understanding of a common research methods that make use of cultural heritage collections for computational analysis. Of course, these descriptions are simplified versions of the methods, and are described mostly in the context of their implications for the creation, description, packaging, or distribution of collections as data. It should be used in the context of the principles articulated in the [Santa Barbara Statement on Collections as Data](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/). 

## The Template

### What is it? 
A one or two sentence massive oversimplification of what it is followed by a few quotes from disciplinary definitions with links to other definitions.

Who uses it? 
A rough accounting with some keywords people could look more into about how the method is approached across disciplines 

What form of data is most useful for it? A one or two sentence super clear statement of what this calls for (e.g. format, content type, structured or unstructured, extent, size, accompanying metadata)

What data features might researchers explore when theyâ€™re doing it? A little more information about how the data is used in this method. Less on process and more on what the researchers are trying to see/test/do.

Common Tools A list of tools

Other notes A catch-all for other notes

Examples of this method in use two to three links or citations from researchers using this method

Examples of collections optimized for this use two to three links to collections that have been prepared with this use in mind
